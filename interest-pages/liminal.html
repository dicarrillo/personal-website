                <p>This is a beefy one. Essentially, liminal spaces depict some kind of "transitionary" space, one that is usually not given much individual attention. Think of, for instance, a hotel hallway, devoid of the people who usually walk up and down, and without the context of you needing to leave your hotel room to get somewhere else. However, that is not a strict definition, as some liminal spaces aren't transitory at all, and some transitory spaces are not liminal. It is almost impossible to <em>define</em> what a liminal space is. Instead, identifying them simply comes from seeing enough images to understand the <em>feeling</em> these images are meant to elicit. Take the image to the left. This image is likely the most famous liminal space image on the entire internet, and the one that brought the concept the popularity it has today. This is the original "backrooms" image. "The Backrooms" is a separate concept that I won't delve into here, but it is essentially a fictional universe where liminal spaces such as this one exist. But take a look at the image. There's no people and no furniture. The context in which a place like this might exist has been erased. So what remains? What kind of feelings does it evoke? There is likely a feeling of intrigue, and a bit of uneasiness. But there is also likely a feeling of familiarity. That's not to say that you've been to this place before, but rather some distant, comforting feeling buried deep within your memory. Perhaps you'd like to explore this place? What's around the corner at the end of the room? What's behind us in the room the camera is in? Where do these places lead? Humans built this place for something, and yet that something is lost. <em>These</em> are the feelings liminal spaces elicit.</p>

            <p>I've never created or taken pictures like this. I've never visited the places in the popular liminal space images on the internet. So why am I so interested in them? I think it has something to do with a feeling of connection I have to them. The concept of liminal spaces is one that has only become popular in the last five years, but the feelings the evoke are ones that I have experienced before their popularity. The most specific example I can think of is movie theaters. Have you ever been to a theater where, after buying your snacks, you are walking down the hallways to your theater, and see a sort of mini concession area tucked at the end of a hall? It's not something I've seen for awhile, but as a kid, I always saw these concession areas at movie theaters. My guess is that these are used when the theater is so busy that extra concession stands need to be opened. But I never saw them opened. I only saw them at the end of a hallway with the lights off, no popcorn being made, and no people around. I felt a sense of curiosity, comfort, sadness. <em>That</em> is the feeling of a liminal space, the one that I experienced years before the internet gave it a name. This feeling is one I have experiences time and time again in my life, and finding images like this is one of my favorite things to do.</p>
