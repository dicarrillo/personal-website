                <p>"A Song of Ice and Fire" is a fantasy book series written by George R. R. Martin. The series currently has five released novels, with an additional two being planned. The novels released as of February 2025 are "A Game of Thrones", "A Clash of Kings", "A Storm of Swords", "A Feast for Crows", and "A Dance with Dragons". The story takes place in a fictional world where seasons last years and with two major continents: Westeros and Essos. While Essos becomes increasingly relevant (especially as the series progresses), the majority of the story is focused on Westeros. Hundreds of years ago, seven independent kingdoms existed in Westeros. However, one day, Aegon of the House Targaryen and his sisters used dragons to conquer these seven kingdoms, uniting them under a common rule, with the new kingdom being simply known as the "Seven Kingdoms". Roughly fifteen years before the events first book, a rebellion led by Robert of the House Baratheon successfully defeated King Aerys Targaryen and his loyalists, and Robert assumed the throne.</p>

            <p>A Song of Ice and Fire begins roughly fifteen years after Robert's Rebellion. The story covers a great number of events, but these can be wrapped into three primary storylines. The first, and most prevalent (at least in the first three novels) is a great war between several great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms, each vying for power and influence, and a few seeking control over the kingdom as a whole. The second storyline takes place in the very north of the Seven Kingdoms, at and beyond the "Wall", a seven-hundred foot wall spanning the northern border of the Seven Kingdoms and manned by the Night's Watch, an order of men sworn to defend the realm from the dangers that lurk beyond the Wall. This storyline is centered on the rise of a supernatural ice-demon force of creatures known as the "Others" beyond the wall. The final storyline primarily follows Daenerys Targaryen, a granddaughter of the defeated King Aerys Targaryen living in exile across the sea on the continent of Essos. This storyline is focused on Daenerys' rise to power in Essos, and her eventual goal of returning to Westeros to reclaim her rightful throne in the Seven Kingdoms.</p>

            <p>There are far too many things I love about this series to be able to name them all, so here are just a few. The way the story is told is excellent. Martin uses a changing set of POV characters to tell the story, meaning that the reader is always in the head of, and viewing events through the eyes of, a specific character. These characters are often hundreds of miles apart, meaning that the reader often knows more about events going on than any individual character. Martin uses this for dramatic irony time and time again, in incredibly dramatic ways. While there are those three primary storylines, the through-line of it all is change. Things are changing in the world of the story, such as has not happened in hundreds of years. The plot of the story is dense, and incredibly fun and dramatic and heartbreaking to follow. And in the moments where the plot slows down (especially in the fourth and fifth books), Martin's character writing gets to shine, with character work that is unmatched in almost any fictional work.</p>
